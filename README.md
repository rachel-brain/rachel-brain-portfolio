## User Story

```
AS A upcoming web developer
I WANT to showcase my portfolio of deployed work samples
SO THAT I can present the best examples of my work so a potential employer can assess whether I am a good candidate for a position they have available
```

## Description
My motivation for undertaking this project was to update my portfolio with recent web development work.  It is to use as an adjunct to my resume, giving me the ability to present the best examples of my coding work.  It was also a good chance to refactor my code & to give it a better appearance in multiple screen sizes.
